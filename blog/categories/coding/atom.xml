<div>I do alright with css positioning but I just don't do enough css to have it mastered; anyhow I needed to float an image over into the right upper corner of a form, no problem put a div at the bottom of the form with position relative and top at -xyz. this worked but was not ideal, depending on the amount of fields in the form I would have to adjust the top setting for each, also the alignment was not consistent enough across browsers, so a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=css+postion+image+in+right+corner+of+div">google search</a> was on once again...<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Came across <a href="http://www.barelyfitz.com/screencast/html-training/css/positioning/">this great post</a>, see tab 4 "position:relative + position:absolute", using a relative div with a nested absolute div, I did not even know this was possible but it appears to work great!</div><div><br /></div></div>

well after a few days with CookieSwap it seems a bit buggy, basically if you open two browser instances and then switch the CookieSwap profile it is updating both browser instances making it somewhat useless?<br /><br />so I did some more <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Managing%20profiles">googling</a> and now using this technique <br /><br />Initial Setup<br />- close all instances of firefox<br />- Start -> Run -> firefox.exe -ProfileManager<br />- create 5 or so profiles, I named them p1 - p5<br /><br />Then when you want to use different profiles launch each one from the command line<br />- Start -> Run -> firefox.exe -P p1 -no-remote<br /><br />each profile is totally distinct (history, cookies, etc...), only issue there does not seem to be an easy way to tell which profile you currently have open, I think I can live with that</div>

You can use different skins in different profiles to distinguish them easily.</div>

I like FireFox but still use IE most of the time; one of the main reasons is during web application development I need to login to the same web application as different users at the same time, switching back and forth between each user account. IE makes it easy just open a new instance for each individual user account.<br /><br />In the past I tried to find a solution for FireFox, but always came up short. Well today I did a google search and came up with two different ones!<br /><br />both are FireFox extensions<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.nektra.com/oss/firefox/extensions/cookiepie/">CookiePie</a></li><li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3255">CookieSwap</a></li></ul><p>after a quik spin with both I am liking CookieSwap better</p><p>With CookiePie you right click on the individual tab to toggle seperate cookie sessions on or off; just didn't have good luck using it the way I would do stuff with IE</p><p>With CookieSwap you right click in the lower right hand status bar area of FireFox and can toggle between named profiles (default is Profile1, Profile2, Profile3) - this worked right out of the box as I would expect!</p><p> </p></div>

a while back I had to set up reporting services; <em>most</em> of the errors do not get logged to the event log, instead they are logged to a file:<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><strong>{drive}\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\{instance}\Reporting Services\LogFiles</strong></span></div>
