    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
Well the best binoculars for birding are probably <a href="http://www.swarovskioptik.at/index.php?l=us&amp;css=&amp;nID=x434b769e932b90.44843491&amp;c=produkte">Swarovski</a> or <a href="http://www.zeiss.com/C1256BCF0020BE5F/allBySubject/7C0C4CE74A32E9ED852571CB00499727">Zeiss</a>, but both of these are very expensive and if you want to get really close to the same quality but for a third of the price I highly recommend Savannah Phase-Coated Waterproof Binoculars from <a href="http://www.telescope.com/">Orion</a>. The Savannah comes in at less then $400 vs over $1000. <div><br /><div><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.telescope.com/control/category/~category_id=binocular_birding/~pcategory=binoculars"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 177px; height: 150px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vmq8pP42BnQ/SXIb3Rdw1mI/AAAAAAAABEA/vbGS8Qr5KQY/s400/28323432-177x150-0-0.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5292323148508747362" /></a><br /></div><div>Don't get me wrong, a good friend of mine has a pair of Swarovski and they are excellent! The key difference is in low light conditions the Swarovski do out perform the Orions but for most of the birding I do the Orions do the job and do it well. I have been using the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Orion-Savannah-Phase-Coated-Waterproof-Binoculars/dp/B0000XMRIK">10x50</a> for over 4 years now and they are great for birding from the car, a smaller pair would be more ideal for hiking or other on the move activities.</div><div><ul><li><a href="http://www.telescope.com/control/product/~category_id=binocular_birding/~pcategory=binoculars/~product_id=09382">Savannah 8x32 Phase-Coated, WP Binoculars</a><br /></li><li><a href="http://www.telescope.com/control/product/~category_id=binocular_birding/~pcategory=binoculars/~product_id=09377">Savannah 8x42 Waterproof Binoculars</a></li></ul><div>Not sure why they name those two models differently they are both Phase-Coated and waterproof - they are the exactly the same just different size. Also, looking around on Orions site I do not see the 10x50 available anymore (one pair left over at Amazon)? hopefully they have not discontinued those. There is the <a href="http://www.telescope.com/control/product/~product_id=09385">Savannah Porro 10x50</a> but I am not familiar with that model, it appears to be less expensive and might be great buy for the money?</div></div></div></div>

Crazy day of birding<br /><br />The first real cold days have hit - crispy and clear, so I headed out towards Valley Ford with Larry.<br /><br />We saw the usual - Red tails, Red Shoulder, Norther Harrier, Kestrel, (where was the white-tailed kite?) and then the good stuff 1 Ferrug, 4 Rough-legged and 9 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Eagle">Golden Eagles</a>!!!<br /><br />Most of the eagles were hanging out in pairs, but at one point we had 4 in our sight at once (that was a first for me), 2 pairs I believe. They were all in the vicinity of a dead lamb, the first one we spotted was actually perched on the lamb getting ready to eat.<br /><br />last week was good to - first week we saw any rough-leg; Next week can only be better but don't think I'll see that many Goldens in one day for a long time.</div>

    <link href="http://jessehouse.com/blog/2007/10/14/peregrine-sighting-in-gualala/"/>
    <updated>2007-10-14T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jessehouse.com/blog/2007/10/14/peregrine-sighting-in-gualala</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
We went away for the weekend up to a bed and breakfast in Gualala - the <a href="http://www.breakersinn.com/">Breakers Inn</a><br />a bit on the expensive side but they have pretty nice rooms with great decks that look out over the Gualala river where it comes into the ocean. The weather was perfect, not a cloud in the sky all weekend and no fog either - fall really the best time of year on the Northern California coast.<br /><br />So there I was sitting on the deck enjoying the sunshine and checking out the seagulls and other water fowl hanging out in the river when all of a sudden they are all flying up in the air (often a sign that a predator is in the area) and so I am looking around in this swarm of birds and there it is a juvenile Peregrine Falcon. He takes a couple of stoops on some water fowl, like 3 or 4 times but nothing doing so he starts heading up the river just a few hundred yards and sees a lone water fowl in the river, next thing I know the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peregrine_Falcon">Peregrine</a> is diving in on this bird from 15 to 20 feet above the water, coming in from the right and then back from the left, each time the water fowl would avoid being hit by ducking into the water at the last minute - this went on for what seemed like over 5 minutes, I gave up counting how many times he stooped in on the bird after about 40.<br /><br />So this Peregrine is really determined (probably real hungry) and finally gets the killer blow on the water fowl. He lands on the shore and rests for a few minutes then is back at it, but this time trying to pick the kill up out of the water, takes awhile but he finally grabs it; too heavy to pull out of the water so he flys just out of the water for a bit before dropping in the water and swimming the last 10 feet to the shore.<br /><br />After a short rest he starts to pluck the feathers and eat some of it. But life is not easy at the top of the food chain. Some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_Vulture">Turkey Vultures</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven">Ravens</a> move in and start hanging around the Peregrine. He did not get to eat too much of it before the Ravens move in a steal it from him, they flew off with the kill and the Peregrine tried to pursue and they all went out of my view from there; I doubt the Peregrine was going to get anymore of it at that point.<br /><br />This was the craziest bird sighting I have ever witnessed - would have been really cool to have a video camera, although it probably would not due the sighting justice.</div>

<strong>Day 1 - the drive down, part I</strong><br /><br />down Hwy 5 and over to Hwy 58 to Barstow where we stayed the night. On the way we saw lots of Red Tails and Kestrels; stopped by the <a href="http://natureali.org/KNWR.htm">Kern National Wildlife Refuge</a>, been wanting to check it out for sometime. On the way in to the refuge on Corcoran Road we had a great Golden Eagle sighting, perched on the power pole right by the side of the road. Then we hit the <a href="http://natureali.org/images/KNWR/KNWR_map.jpg">auto tour route</a> where we saw numerous red tails, some kestrels, about 1/2 a dozen coopers hawks (some were very close sightings), a White-tailed Kite, some coots and other water fowl (I expected to see alot more, but they are probably all up at <a href="http://www.fws.gov/sacramentovalleyrefuges/">sac</a>?), then the best sighting of day was a Short-eared Owl, it came in behind the car, around the back of a tree, then worked it's way up to a water wheel, perched up for about a minute and then came directly back towards the car giving us great looks, lightning was great and everything, I probably would have tried to get some pics but my camera was giving me some '<a href="http://www.richardsnotes.org/archives/2005/04/29/50mm-lens-contact-points/">Err 99</a>' issue when taking pictures at 400mm (frustrating to say the least). On the way out Garces Hwy going towards Bakersfield we saw another Golden Eagle on a power pole right by the road (possible that it was the same bird as before? but did not look like it).<br /><br /><strong>Day 2 - the drive down, part II<br /></strong><br />Barstow to Paulden with a side trip to the Grand Canyon. Saw some small herds of Prong Horn along the side of the highway 40 as well as 2 separate pairs of Golden Eagles on some large power poles, but the good raptor sightings were on the way to the Grand Canyon on Hwy 64 - a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk on a power pole just past the gas station and then a Merlin sitting on a snag about a mile past the entrance to the park.<br /><br /><p><a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/133/338576101_59fe082191.jpg"><img style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/133/338576101_59fe082191.jpg" border="0" /></a><br /><br />The Grand Canyon is quite spectacular, surprising that I had never actually seen it in person before? One of these days I would like to do some hiking there, but definitely not in the winter. Beware - it cost $25.00 to get into the park!!! kinda steep if you ask me...<br /><br /><strong>Day 3</strong><br /><br />Claire went out on a road ride, I went hiking around in the 'back yard', came across an huge canyon that was pretty cool, I think it is the headwaters of the Verde River, not sure? birds of note; road runner and 3 rock wrens<br /><br /><strong>Day 4</strong><br /><br />Went MTB riding from the Williams Valley trailhead, fun stuff; see other post for more info. On the way saw a Merlin, Ferug and a sweet dark morph Ferug (got the pic of him on Christmas day). Chino Valley is the spot for Ferug in winter - for sure!<br /><br /><strong>Day 5</strong><br /><br />It snowed this morning, about an inch I guess; Went to Prescott on the way there was a Prairie Falcon on a power pole at the corner of Hwy 89 and Old Hwy 89, this was the only one I saw on the trip.<br /><br /><strong>Day 6</strong><br /><br />MTB ride in Thumb Butte area; see other post;<br />Excellent Cooper's Hawk sighting on the ride.<br /><br /><strong>Day 7</strong><br /><br />Claire went out on a big road ride, can't remember what I did ?<br /><br /><strong>Day 8, Christmas day</strong><br /><br /><a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/124/338538563_726490a6dd_b.jpg"><img style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; WIDTH: 240px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/124/338538563_726490a6dd_m.jpg" border="0" /></a>Took Katie and Pat out birding around Chino Valley; what can I say Ferruginous Hawks really like this area in the winter; we saw at least a 1/2 dozen in less then an hour. The highlight being this dark morph bird. I actually went back a few hours later that day to take some pictures, this bird was very cooperative and let me get really close to the power pole he was perched on before taking off. Got a few other shots of light morphs as well but nothing too spectacular.<br /><br /><strong>Day 9</strong><br /><br />went on a MTB ride on the BLM land behind the Rim Rock area - up to Little Thumb Butte<br /><br /><strong>Day 10</strong><br /><br />Claire went out on a long horse ride, I just sat around, drank beer and played cards.<br /><br /><strong>Day 11 - the drive home part I</strong><br /><br />So we decided we had better check out Sedona and Flagstaff before we went home; when we woke up there was at least an inch of snow on the ground so our planned MTB ride in Sedona was quickly shot down.<br /><br /><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5014430049960739458" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vmq8pP42BnQ/RZbVkBb0QoI/AAAAAAAAAA8/Whj3CAda6vo/s400/153_5323_RJ.jpg" border="0" /><br /><br />We basically just spend the day driving and checking out the beautiful scenery around Sedona before going on a short birding excursion around Upper Mary, Lower Mary and Mormon Lakes.<br /><br />Visibility was not good at all due to falling snow and road conditions were not so good either, we were able to get a great sighting of a juvenile Bald Eagle, he flew parallel and level to the car and then directly above for quite some time. Other then that just saw some Red Tails. Flagstaff has a pretty cool down town area, its kinda sad the hills around there have been logged so extensively.<br /><br /><strong>Day 12 - the drive home part II</strong><br /><br />13 hours from Flagstaff to home, pretty uneventful, saw two Ferruginous Hawks between Kingman and Needles and lots of desert... </p><p>It's been a long time since I have taken this many days off work, I highly recommend it!<br /></p><p></p></div>
