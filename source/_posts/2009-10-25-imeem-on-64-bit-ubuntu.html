<p>Getting flash to work correctly on 64-bit <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> can be challenging. By following various blog and forum posts I was able to get it to work, but never the flash player for <a href="http://www.imeem.com/">imeem</a>. Every now and again I would try to re-install flash and see if it would work for imeem but until last night I was never successful. </p><p>It turns out that imeem will only work with the 32-bit flash player. After so much work to get the 64-bit player working in Firefox 3.0 and 3.5 I did not want to remove it so I downloaded Opera and installed the 32-bit player under its plugin directory and <a href="http://www.imeem.com/">imeem</a> works great!</p><ul><li>Download and install <a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/download/">Opera</a></li><li>verify that you cannot play music in <a href="http://www.imeem.com/">imeem</a></li><li>Close Opera</li><li>download the <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/">32-bit flash player</a> in '.tar.gz' format</li><li>extract the libflashplayer.so file from the archive</li><li>then you will need to put this in the directory /usr/lib/opera/plugins/</li><li>you won't have permissions to write to that directory unless you are in sudo mode</li><li>open a terminal and type '<em>sudo nautilus</em>'</li><li>copy the file into the directory (you could do this from the terminal window also probably '<em>sudo mv libflashplayer.so /usr/lib/opera/plugins/libflashplayer.so</em>'</li><li>Open Opera</li><li>check the plugins - type opera:plugins in the address bar</li><li>you should see Shockwave Flash and it should be pointing to the libflashplayer.so file under opera plugins, by default my opera installation was pointing to /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/ for the flash plugin, my guess is opera looks for plugins in its own directory and if not found then looks in mozilla directory</li><li>you should now be able to play music with imeem!</li></ul><p>I am running Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope by the way. Here are some links that might work to get the 64-bit player working for Firefox</p><ul><li><a href="http://art.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1297385">http://art.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1297385</a></li><li><a href="http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-adobe-flash-player-10-in-ubuntu-804-hardy-heron.html">http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-adobe-flash-player-10-in-ubuntu-804-hardy-heron.html</a></li><li><a href="http://art.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1292438">http://art.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1292438</a></li><li><a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/install-flash-10-ubuntu-linux-64bit.html">http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/install-flash-10-ubuntu-linux-64bit.html</a></li><li>this last one is probably the best bet, check the comments there</li></ul><p><br /></p></div>
