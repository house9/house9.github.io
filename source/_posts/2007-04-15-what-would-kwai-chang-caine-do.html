<strong>What would Kwai Chang Caine do?</strong><br /><br />we've all heard of "<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_would_Jesus_do%3F">What would Jesus do?</a></em>", but at this point I am more interested in what Kwai Chang Caine would do; <p>here are just a few great quotes from the Kung Fu series, I don't want to list too many as each should really be cherished on it's own...</p><br /><blockquote><em><span style="font-size:180%;">"If one's words are not better than silence, one should keep silent."</span></em></blockquote><br /><blockquote><em><span style="font-size:180%;">"In every loss there is gain. As in every gain there is loss."</span></em></blockquote><br /><blockquote><em><span style="font-size:180%;">"Our soul does not keep time, it merely records growth."</span></em></blockquote><br />And my favorite... <blockquote><em><span style="font-size:180%;">"I seek not to know all the answers but to understand the questions."</span></em></blockquote></div>

&quot;We own nothing. Even our bodies are loaned to us. Empty shells. Concentrate on the infinite and ignore the temporal.&quot; - Kwai Chang Caine</div>
