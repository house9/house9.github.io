I have used <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/snagitmac/">Snag-it</a> on Windows for many years - it is a great product!<div><br /></div><div>During the last year I have been using <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> and Mac and been missing Snag-it; <a href="http://www.ubuntugeek.com/shutter-featureful-screenshot-tool.html">Shutter</a> on Ubuntu is 'ok', but not quite on the same level as Snag-it</div><div><br /></div><div>I was happy to discover that there was a beta of Snag-it for the Mac</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.techsmith.com/snagitmac/">http://www.techsmith.com/snagitmac/</a></div><div><br /></div><div>Free right now, been using it for the last month - it seems even better than the version for windows!</div></div>
