my GE Microwave worked great until the one year warranty was up, then it developed this really cool feature where the fan will not turn off - unless...<div><br /></div><div>usually if I have the fan on and want to turn it off, I setting it to off (but it stays on) and then do a quick cook of 2 minutes, 8 out of 10 times this will turn off the fan when it finishes, other times it will turn if I do the 2 minute quick cook again - but that doesn't always work either...</div><div><br /></div><div>sometimes I have to unplug the thing to turn off the fan, out of curiosity I googled 'GE Microwave fan' and came across this youtube video that pretty much tells the tale</div><div><br /></div><br /><div><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/L8FOy6dAf4w&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/L8FOy6dAf4w&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /></div><br /><div>Don't you just love quality products...</div></div>
