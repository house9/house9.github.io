well after a few days with CookieSwap it seems a bit buggy, basically if you open two browser instances and then switch the CookieSwap profile it is updating both browser instances making it somewhat useless?<br /><br />so I did some more <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Managing%20profiles">googling</a> and now using this technique <br /><br />Initial Setup<br />- close all instances of firefox<br />- Start -> Run -> firefox.exe -ProfileManager<br />- create 5 or so profiles, I named them p1 - p5<br /><br />Then when you want to use different profiles launch each one from the command line<br />- Start -> Run -> firefox.exe -P p1 -no-remote<br /><br />each profile is totally distinct (history, cookies, etc...), only issue there does not seem to be an easy way to tell which profile you currently have open, I think I can live with that</div>

You can use different skins in different profiles to distinguish them easily.</div>
