<div class='post'>
<div>I do alright with css positioning but I just don't do enough css to have it mastered; anyhow I needed to float an image over into the right upper corner of a form, no problem put a div at the bottom of the form with position relative and top at -xyz. this worked but was not ideal, depending on the amount of fields in the form I would have to adjust the top setting for each, also the alignment was not consistent enough across browsers, so a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=css+postion+image+in+right+corner+of+div">google search</a> was on once again...<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Came across <a href="http://www.barelyfitz.com/screencast/html-training/css/positioning/">this great post</a>, see tab 4 "position:relative + position:absolute", using a relative div with a nested absolute div, I did not even know this was possible but it appears to work great!</div><div><br /></div></div>
