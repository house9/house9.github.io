<div class='post'>
a while back I had to set up reporting services; <em>most</em> of the errors do not get logged to the event log, instead they are logged to a file:<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><strong>{drive}\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\{instance}\Reporting Services\LogFiles</strong></span></div>
