I really did enjoy it then, but I really appreciate it alot more now and for different reasons; then it was all about the kung fu action, the wild west and Shaolin priests;<br /><br />It is amazing how this show doesn't really feel very dated, well maybe just a little but in that cool 1970's kinda way. I highly recommend that you watch this show - especially if you have never seen it.<br /><br />Check out <a href="http://www.kungfu-guide.com/">http://www.kungfu-guide.com/</a> for indepth information on the show or just go to Amazon and order the first season - you will not be disappointed!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00013F38K/continguidetothe">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00013F38K/continguidetothe</a></div>
