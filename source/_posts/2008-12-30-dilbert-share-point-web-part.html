I have a love hate relationship with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/prodinfo/what.mspx">Microsoft Share Point</a>. It has really good integration with <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/">Office products</a> but also has a lot of irritating 'features'. Anyhow I knew there had to be a web part out there to get the latest <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/">Dilbert</a> comic strip and after a quick <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=dilbert+share+point+web+part">Google search</a> I found it!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nogeekleftbehind.com/2007/11/21/download-daily-dilbert-web-part-for-sharepoint/">http://www.nogeekleftbehind.com/2007/11/21/download-daily-dilbert-web-part-for-sharepoint/</a><br /><br />no share point portal is complete without it!</div>
