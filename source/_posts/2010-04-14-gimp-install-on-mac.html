Don't bother installing <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> using <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>; I started this process and it ran for over an hour before I stopped the install. It has alot of dependencies and MacPorts was busy installing all of them.<br /><br />Just go to <a href="http://gimp.lisanet.de/Website/Download.html">http://gimp.lisanet.de/Website/Download.html</a> and download the package for your OS version<br /><br />around 75mb download but installed in minutes :)</div>
