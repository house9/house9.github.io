<div class='post'>
Just switched to a different Blogger Template - much wider and mo better!<br /><br />Also consolidated my posting, I had 20+ code samples on another blog. Used the Blogger <a href="http://www.google.com/support/blogger/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=97416">import / export tool</a>&nbsp;which was pretty seamless; needed to move a few code blocks over to <a href="http://gist.github.com/">gists</a> to get proper formatting but that was it!</div>
