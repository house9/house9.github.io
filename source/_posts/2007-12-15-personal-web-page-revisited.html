Ok, it has been 5 years since I have updated my personal webpage, once again it is just a 1 page web site; lean and mean ~:P<br /><br />It might load a bit slow; I am using some of the libraries from <a href="http://www.extjs.com/">Ext JS</a> - a few hundred K in css, images and js to load in, should cache in the browser after the first hit, their UI widgets are just too cool.<br /><br />anyhow here it is - <a href="http://www.jessehouse.com/">http://www.jessehouse.com/</a></div>

Move your &lt;script&gt; tags to the bottom of the page, right before &lt;/html&gt; and you will see a speed improvement.</div>
