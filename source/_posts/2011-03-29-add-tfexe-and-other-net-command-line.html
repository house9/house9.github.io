I really don't like cmd.exe, it is difficult to work with. PowerShell ISE is much nicer and the bonus is you can run non powershell programs from this environment as well.<br /><br />I needed to run some TFS commands, adding the ide directory to the path is easy<br /><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="background-color: yellow;">$env:path += ";C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE"</span></blockquote>another directory you might want to add if you are messing about with IIS7<br /><br /><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="background-color: yellow;">$env:path += ";C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv"&nbsp;</span></blockquote>now you can do things like recycle all of the AppPools on your machine<br /><br /><blockquote>appcmd list apppool /xml | appcmd recycle apppool /in</blockquote></div>
