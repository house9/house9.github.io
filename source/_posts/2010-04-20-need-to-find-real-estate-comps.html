Need to find real estate comps? <a href="http://www.redfin.com/">www.redfin.com</a> is a sweet site. Not only can you search for new homes on the MLS listings but you can also search previous Sale Records. I don't know of any other site that offers the same functionality. Click the 'More Options' link by the 'Search Listings' button.<div><br /></div><div>Another really nice feature, If you find a bunch of homes for sale in a viewable area on the map, click the 'DOWNLOAD' link to get all of the info in excel (csv).</div></div>
