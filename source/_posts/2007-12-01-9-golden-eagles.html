<div class='post'>
Crazy day of birding<br /><br />The first real cold days have hit - crispy and clear, so I headed out towards Valley Ford with Larry.<br /><br />We saw the usual - Red tails, Red Shoulder, Norther Harrier, Kestrel, (where was the white-tailed kite?) and then the good stuff 1 Ferrug, 4 Rough-legged and 9 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Eagle">Golden Eagles</a>!!!<br /><br />Most of the eagles were hanging out in pairs, but at one point we had 4 in our sight at once (that was a first for me), 2 pairs I believe. They were all in the vicinity of a dead lamb, the first one we spotted was actually perched on the lamb getting ready to eat.<br /><br />last week was good to - first week we saw any rough-leg; Next week can only be better but don't think I'll see that many Goldens in one day for a long time.</div>
