I've been working on this project off and on for quite sometime. If you are a small to mid size business in California and you need Safety Documents and&nbsp;Safety Management Software check out <a href="http://www.safetysanity.com/">www.safetysanity.com</a>.<br /><br />Use this code to save $100 off the setup fees<br /><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="background-color: yellow;">2011-SAVE-100</span></blockquote>We've simplified the process of creating a Safety Program; starting with Safety Document creation through managing Employee Training, Equipment Inspections and Accident Reporting.<br /><blockquote><a href="http://www.safetysanity.com/">www.safetysanity.com</a></blockquote>Our software application &nbsp;generates a Safety Program which is compliant with Cal/OSHA regulations. Every business in California is required by law to not only have a Safety Program, but also prove that they are following their program. Safety Sanity makes it easy!
