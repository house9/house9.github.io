Just started using the <a href="http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate">will_paginate</a> plugin for my rails application. I wanted a Flickr or Digg style applied to the paging controls, did not find anything that came 'out 0f the box'. After a few google searches I came across this <a href="http://workingwithrails.com/railsplugin/4765-will-paginate">link</a> which had an example - apparently from an older version of the README file.<div><br /></div><div>here is that css for reference</div><div><script src="http://gist.github.com/333019.js?file=Digg+style+css+for+will_paginate"></script></div><div><br /></div><div>.</div></div>
