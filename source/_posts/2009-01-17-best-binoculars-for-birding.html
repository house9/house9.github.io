Well the best binoculars for birding are probably <a href="http://www.swarovskioptik.at/index.php?l=us&amp;css=&amp;nID=x434b769e932b90.44843491&amp;c=produkte">Swarovski</a> or <a href="http://www.zeiss.com/C1256BCF0020BE5F/allBySubject/7C0C4CE74A32E9ED852571CB00499727">Zeiss</a>, but both of these are very expensive and if you want to get really close to the same quality but for a third of the price I highly recommend Savannah Phase-Coated Waterproof Binoculars from <a href="http://www.telescope.com/">Orion</a>. The Savannah comes in at less then $400 vs over $1000. <div><br /><div><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.telescope.com/control/category/~category_id=binocular_birding/~pcategory=binoculars"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 177px; height: 150px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vmq8pP42BnQ/SXIb3Rdw1mI/AAAAAAAABEA/vbGS8Qr5KQY/s400/28323432-177x150-0-0.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5292323148508747362" /></a><br /></div><div>Don't get me wrong, a good friend of mine has a pair of Swarovski and they are excellent! The key difference is in low light conditions the Swarovski do out perform the Orions but for most of the birding I do the Orions do the job and do it well. I have been using the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Orion-Savannah-Phase-Coated-Waterproof-Binoculars/dp/B0000XMRIK">10x50</a> for over 4 years now and they are great for birding from the car, a smaller pair would be more ideal for hiking or other on the move activities.</div><div><ul><li><a href="http://www.telescope.com/control/product/~category_id=binocular_birding/~pcategory=binoculars/~product_id=09382">Savannah 8x32 Phase-Coated, WP Binoculars</a><br /></li><li><a href="http://www.telescope.com/control/product/~category_id=binocular_birding/~pcategory=binoculars/~product_id=09377">Savannah 8x42 Waterproof Binoculars</a></li></ul><div>Not sure why they name those two models differently they are both Phase-Coated and waterproof - they are the exactly the same just different size. Also, looking around on Orions site I do not see the 10x50 available anymore (one pair left over at Amazon)? hopefully they have not discontinued those. There is the <a href="http://www.telescope.com/control/product/~product_id=09385">Savannah Porro 10x50</a> but I am not familiar with that model, it appears to be less expensive and might be great buy for the money?</div></div></div></div>
