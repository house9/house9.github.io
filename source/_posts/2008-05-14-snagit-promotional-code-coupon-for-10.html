<div class='post'>
I have used <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.asp">SnagIt</a> off and on over the past few years, usually with the trial version for a month here and there, finally broke down and got a license.<br />It runs $39.95 for single user - so I did a quick google search to see if any promotional codes were available and came across one - the promotional code SNUG will get you $10.00 off the standard price. The posting I found for this discount was from 2007 and it is now May 2008 so who knows how long it will be around?<br /><br /><a href="http://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.asp">SnagIt</a> is a great tool - if you have never used it I recommend downloading the trial, best screen capture tool ever!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">UPDATE 2009-01-07:</span> the promo code SNUG expired on 2008-12-31, bummer; it was great while it lasted!<span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;"></span></div>

Gary, the price of snagit went up to 49.95 with version 9, so the price of 39.95 does reflect the $10.00 discount</div>

Just purchased Snagit using the Snug promo code, I received a message that I would get the $10 discount, however at billing I was still charged $39.95. I am sending a request for a refund to TechSmith. Even if I don't get the discount, awesome product.</div>
