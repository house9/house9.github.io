<div class='post'>
Buy.com and Google checkout doesn't work - I don't think I'll be using either product going forward.<br /><br />I select 3 items, each with free shipping, select check out, select Google Checkout and I am presented with shipping costs none of which says 'Free'<br /><br />I've used Google checkout a few times before without issue and I've ordered from buy.com before without issue, but after wasting my time with 'false advertising' - no more<br /><br />I guess I'll go order my stuff from Amazon instead.</div>
