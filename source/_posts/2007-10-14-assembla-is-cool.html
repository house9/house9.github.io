Check out - <a href="http://www.assembla.com/">http://www.assembla.com/</a><br /><br />right now I am just using it for the 200MB of free svn repository for my first rails projects (always important to have a back up); but they have so much more to offer as well - Job Board, Distributed Team management tools, etc...</div>
