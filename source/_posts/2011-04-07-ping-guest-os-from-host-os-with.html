<div class='post'>
I am running a host Windows 7 machine with a Guest Windows Server 2008 RC2. The guest machine is hosted inside of <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>. It appears that this issue can occur with any number of OS host or guest machines.<br /><br />From the guest machine I could access the internet and access the host machine, but I could not ping or access the guest machine from the host. Turns out there is a network setting that needs to be changed.<br /><br />On the guests 'container' go to Devices &gt; Network Adapters<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3wcZuLntxu0/TZ3UqMsu66I/AAAAAAAAC0Q/7rAucnEe0ts/s1600/virtualbox-host-ping-guest-01.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="388" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3wcZuLntxu0/TZ3UqMsu66I/AAAAAAAAC0Q/7rAucnEe0ts/s640/virtualbox-host-ping-guest-01.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />Then change 'Attached to' from 'NAT' to 'Bridged Adapter'<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9l70Yl2d02s/TZ3U2_-I1vI/AAAAAAAAC0U/0SrzQDCS9J8/s1600/virtualbox-host-ping-guest-02.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="368" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9l70Yl2d02s/TZ3U2_-I1vI/AAAAAAAAC0U/0SrzQDCS9J8/s640/virtualbox-host-ping-guest-02.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />at that point you should be good to go<br /><br />Resources<br /><br /><ul><li>virtualbox forums: <a href="http://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=15792&amp;sid=96a654bdcb88ff0b628c108663f681ce&amp;start=15">Host can't ping guest in Different OS ??</a></li></ul></div>

I did that, they are in the same network but I can&#39;t ping from either side, What do I have to do?  the other comments says to change the setting from public to private HOW?</div>

Thanks for your post.  I was having the same problem between a Win 7 Pro host and a Win 8 Customer Preview guest and solved it using your method.<br /><br />The only extra thing I had to do was change the guest network setting from a public network to private and now I can ping both ways.</div>
