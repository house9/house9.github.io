Just installed Ubuntu Desktop on my 'old' (not that old really) Dell Dimension 2400 Celeron. Don't use this computer much anymore and have been wanting to check out Ubuntu.<br /><br />well the install was way too easy.<br /><span style="font-size:78%;">- downloaded the iso image from </span><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download"><span style="font-size:78%;">http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download</span></a><span style="font-size:78%;"><br />- burned it to a cd using </span><a href="http://infrarecorder.sourceforge.net/"><span style="font-size:78%;">InfraRecorder</span></a><span style="font-size:78%;"><br />- put that in the old 2400 and selected boot from CD-ROM<br />- Ubuntu OS booted from the CD and I was up and running at that point; but only from disc<br />- Had to click the install short cut on the desk top and wait a short while</span><br /><br />That was it - no driver issues at all!!!<br />I was on my network and downloading the Ubuntu updates immediately, browing the internet with FireFox and watching avi files with Totem ...<br /><br />One really cool thing with Ubuntu (maybe Linux in general?) with out any additional installs I could navigate to my other Windows machines and pull files off the File Shares; simple as going to 'Places' -> 'Network' -> 'Windows Network' -> selecting the machine to browse to<br /><br />Later I might look into setting up <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=202605">Samba</a> so I can share from Windows to the Linux machine<br /><br />Definitly going to install the Ubuntu Server Edition on my laptop soon and create a simple web site using Ruby on Rails, just need to find that 'extra' time<br /><br />Thanks to my Dad for turning me on to Ubuntu!</div>
