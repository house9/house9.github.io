Oak Park resident Julie Bass now faces serious charges for setting up a vegetable garden in her front yard.<br /><br />Help her out sign the petition here: <a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/oak-park-hates-veggies/">http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/oak-park-hates-veggies/</a><br /><br /><br />We are requesting that the City of Oak Park, MI cease its prosecution against its resident Julie Bass for the supposed crime of growing vegetables in her front yard. The bylaw they are pursuing criminal charges under is poorly written and does not explicitly state that you cannot grow vegetables. The prosecutor representing the city wants to take this case to trial, and the associated charge carries a maximum sentence of 93 days in jail. It would be a travesty for this mother of six to be sentenced to 93 days in jail for the simple act of growing tomatoes in her front yard.<br /><br />Details about the case can be found at <a href="http://oakparkhatesveggies.wordpress.com/">http://oakparkhatesveggies.wordpress.com/</a><br /><div><br /></div></div>
