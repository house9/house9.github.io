Ok I finally completed my first rails project. Tic Tac Toe on Rails, you can check it out at <a href="http://www.tictactoeonrails.com/">http://www.tictactoeonrails.com/</a>. It was a good reminder for me of how long it takes to really get up to speed on new technologies, Rails is really cool but it is definitely not a silver bullet for building web applications, when you get right down to it building software is hard work no matter which technology you choose to use.</div>
