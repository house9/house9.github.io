My first post using Octopress!

Followed the fine documenation here: [http://octopress.org/docs/](http://octopress.org/docs/) to get up and running.

And used this script [https://gist.github.com/juniorz/1564581](https://gist.github.com/juniorz/1564581) to import all of my old posts from blogger. It failed to import a few posts but overall worked great!

I do have various formatting issues on older posts, will need to revisit those in the future...

Authoring with markdown is so much better and no need for embedded gist: ya!

```ruby
puts "Hello Octopress"
```

```javascript
console.log("Hello Octopress");
```
