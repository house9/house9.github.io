<div class='post'>
here is a bash script I put together to launch my rails development environment, i got tired of opening multiple terminal windows and cd to the project dir, this script<br /><ul><li>launches script/server in a terminal window</li><li>launches a new terminal and cd to the trunk</li><li>launches firefox at http://localhost:3000 with a specific <a href="http://house9.blogspot.com/2008/04/update-firefox-and-multiple-cookies-for.html">firefox profile</a></li><li>and launches <a href="http://house9.blogspot.com/2008/05/komodo-edit-new-text-editor-of-choice.html">Komodo Edit</a> - go ahead and pick the editor of your choice<br /></li></ul>this works on <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, probably on other Linux distro's that use <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a><br /><br /><script src="http://gist.github.com/106173.js"></script><br /><br />I saved this in a file ~/scripts/launch_YOUR_PROJECT.sh<br />to execute this open a terminal and type ~$ bash ./scripts/launch_YOUR_PROJECT.sh<br />or create a symlink in your home directory<br /><br /><script src="http://gist.github.com/106180.js"></script><br /><br />then execute using ~$ bash launch_YOUR_PROJECT<br /><br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> in theory you should not need to even specify bash at the command prompt, when I did not I received the following error "<span style="font-style: italic;">bash: launch_YOUR_PROJECT: command not found</span>"<br />running '<span style="font-style: italic;">which bash</span>' returns '<span style="font-style: italic;">/bin/bash</span>' which is specified in the shell script?, something to look into later.</div>
