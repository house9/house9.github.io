I was doing some clean up on one of our database servers; we have many databases created with backup/restore for testing purposes I was checking for the largest ldf files and making sure those databases were in simple mode and then shirking the data files, there were a few files I could not match to the databases because the mdf and ldf file names were different from the actual database file name - found the following queries using a few google searches<div><br /></div><br /><div><br /><script src="http://gist.github.com/86181.js"></script><br /></div><br /><div><br /><script src="http://gist.github.com/86182.js"></script><br /></div></div>
