This post is for personal reference, I keep losing track of the url to this great resource. Ruby on Rails guides at <a href="http://guides.rails.info/">http://guides.rails.info/</a> I think this site launched when rails 2.1 came out, it is still a work in progress but is an extremely valuable resource covering everything from 'getting started', active record associations, security, debugging, the new 2.2 Rails Internationalization API and more.<br /><br />Ruby on Rails guides at <a href="http://guides.rails.info/">http://guides.rails.info/</a></div>
