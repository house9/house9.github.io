well I guess it had to happen sooner or later - Assembla to start charging for all private services<br /><br />they do offer a great service and the fact that it has been free up until now has been really great!<br />I can understand why they need to start charging and it still seems very reasonable,<br />but it would be nicer if it was based purely on disk space instead of per project<br /><br />read more <a href="http://blog.assembla.com/assemblablog/tabid/12618/bid/6986/Release-2-0-restricting-free-plans-giving-back-with-features-and-pric">here</a></div>

Hi, I'm with ProjectLocker, and we have hosted Subversion, Trac, and soon Git hosting for as little as $2.50/month annualized for 2 users and 1 GB.  Our low-cost plans are metered on space and users but have unlimited projects and no pre-set bandwidth limits.  We also have a number of cool features such as the ability to e-mail tickets to Trac and to run code reviews on Java projects.  If you're looking for a new provider, we encourage you to try us out.</div>
