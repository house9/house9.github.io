I like FireFox but still use IE most of the time; one of the main reasons is during web application development I need to login to the same web application as different users at the same time, switching back and forth between each user account. IE makes it easy just open a new instance for each individual user account.<br /><br />In the past I tried to find a solution for FireFox, but always came up short. Well today I did a google search and came up with two different ones!<br /><br />both are FireFox extensions<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.nektra.com/oss/firefox/extensions/cookiepie/">CookiePie</a></li><li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3255">CookieSwap</a></li></ul><p>after a quik spin with both I am liking CookieSwap better</p><p>With CookiePie you right click on the individual tab to toggle seperate cookie sessions on or off; just didn't have good luck using it the way I would do stuff with IE</p><p>With CookieSwap you right click in the lower right hand status bar area of FireFox and can toggle between named profiles (default is Profile1, Profile2, Profile3) - this worked right out of the box as I would expect!</p><p> </p></div>
